<h3>CD to a directory super fast</h4>

Typing out a long directory path can be a bit painful. Most tools that solve this problem give you less to type but still involve additional steps afterwards. 
Instead of tracking frequently visited directories, using a fuzzy search, or even a ML model to improve the cd experience, fastTravelCLI allows you to directly save a destination as a key-value pair, then you can fast travel to that location by just using the key you set. 
fastTravelCLI is a fast, lightweight, true CD command replacement with additional features built on top. Check out the issues for even more features on the way.

<h4>Why not just use Zoxide?</h4>

Personal preference really. [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) 
is a great tool but the implementation is complex leading to many issues that cause it to be less than ideal for many use cases.
Here are a few examples of Zoxide issues that fastTravelCLI solves gracefully or avoids entirely.

- [CDPATH support](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/issues/620) 
- [Differentiating similarly named directories](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/issues/876)
- [Session history stack navigation](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/issues/839)
- [Navigation local to project](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide/issues/863)

<br></br>

<h4>I already use fzf for most of my in project navigation, why would I use this?</h4>

If you use [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to find a deeply nested directory that you access often, fastTravelCLI takes an experience like this: 
```
cd $(find * -type d | fzf)
```
```

<h1>Usage</h1>
<br></br>

```bash
# Go to a directory you would like to set a waypoint for and run 

ft -set [key]


# Travel to that location by running

ft [key]


# You can also travel to a subdirectory of a key

ft [key]/some/subdir


# ft can replace your cd command entirely

ft relative/dir
ft ..
ft -

# ft supports relative paths in the working directory and CDPATH

ft mydir

# ft allows you to visit previously visited directories

ft [


# Traverse back up your dir history using 

ft ]


# View your saved locations with 

ft -ls


# To remove a location run

ft -rm [key]


# To rename a location run

ft -rn [key] [new key]


# To see a full list of available commands run

ft -help
# or
ft -h
```
<br></br>


<h1>Installation</h1>
<br></br>

Currently available for mac/linux OS and bash/zsh shells. May work in more shell environments but not guarenteed.

<br></br>

Requires go version >= 1.22.0

<br></br>

Clone the repo, cd into it, and run the following based on your OS - 

```
install/linux.sh
```
```
install/mac.sh
```


If you experience issues trying to run the install script as shown, you may need to prefix it with ```bash install/[myOS].sh```

<h1>Contributing</h1>
<br></br>

PRs and suggestions are welcome. I originally made this for myself and took it as a bit of a learning opportunity with some of the features I wanted to add, so there's not alot of structure or official-ness to this. This is why the install steps are just 'clone and run the shell script' instead of being available on Homebrew and other package managers. If for some reason this starts to gain a bit of interest then I'd be more than happy to implement these sort of things or accept PRs that do.
